# lazyload
Lazy tab loading for the Chrome browser
Licensed under the GNU General Public License.

Chrome by default upon restart loads every tab that is currently open,
which takes much more memory and time required than necessary. This
extension allows only the tab currently selected to be loaded at restart,
making Chrome load up much faster.

This extension does not require any actions in part by the user to work.

To get the Chrome extension, visit the Chrome Web Store and search
"Laziest Load".
